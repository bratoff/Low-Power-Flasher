# Low Power Flasher
Ultra low power LED flasher using ATTiny13a

Uses an ATTiny13a in ultra-low-power mode to provide a light that flashes every few seconds.
Intended to be built into other projects to provide a find-in-the-dark, power-on-reminder, etc.

The source code can be built in the Arduino environment - see Arduino folder.
It can also be built using the avr-gcc toolchain - see src folder.

The PCB schematic and board layout are available in eagle format - see eagle folder.
Finished PCBs are available from Oshpark at this link:  https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/rQWvfmNL
